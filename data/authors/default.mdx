## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" />
## I'm N S Rawat (aka NSRawat)

I have a passion for **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. I'm currently a freelance **Data Scientist & ML Engineer**, deeply engaged in transforming complex data into actionable insights, building predictive models, and deploying scalable ML solutions. I work mainly with **Python**, **SQL**, **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Cloud Platforms**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a data scientist and machine learning engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow data scientists and aspiring ML practitioners.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written <Twemoji className="mx-1" emoji="folded-hands" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from leohuynh.dev. I appreciate [Leo Huynh](https://twitter.com/hta218_) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- Upgrading to **React 18**, **Next 14**.
- Adopting **Typescript**, committing with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/) website analytics
- Theming in dark mode with [Tokyonight Neovim Theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) colors for better contrast.
- My website refers to the design and code from the [lehuynh.dev](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev) repository and incorporates the tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog template, version 2.0.
- Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark` plugins and dependencies to the latest version

See my [repository](https://github.com/iNSRawat/nsrawat_portfolio) for this blog.
